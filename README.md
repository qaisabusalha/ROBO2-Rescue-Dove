# ROBO2-Rescue-Dove
This file contains all the software related to Rescue Dove project.
Summary: Palestine has witnessed and continues to experience numerous crises, wars, and disasters. Each of these crises has its own victims and survivors. But how can we increase the number of survivors from these crises? This is where the role of the "Rescue Dove" comes in. When wars and natural disasters occur, rescue teams find themselves racing against time to search for victims under the rubble and reach them in time, often under harsh and dangerous conditions. This dilemma was clearly evident in the last war on Gaza due to the extent of the affected areas being larger than the capabilities of civil defense, in addition to the difficulty of clearing debris areas manually.

Project Importance: When wars and natural disasters occur, rescue teams find themselves racing against time to search for victims under the rubble and reach them in time, often under harsh and dangerous conditions. This dilemma was clearly evident in the last war on Gaza due to the extent of the affected areas being larger than the capabilities of civil defense, in addition to the difficulty of clearing debris areas manually.

Project Objectives: The goal is to search for survivors and those trapped in troubled areas, while reducing the efforts and time required for the search, which contributes to saving more survivors before it's too late.

Methodology: The project relies on several fields and methodologies, including mechanical engineering, aerial robotics, and the lifecycle of system design.

Expected Results: Expectations suggest that the Rescue Dove will become an indispensable tool for the civil defense crew, as it will become an integral part of search operations and a primary pillar. Consequently, the use of the dove will have a direct correlation with the number of survivors, as the more it is used, the higher the chances of finding survivors early.

The Rescue Dove is an unmanned aerial vehicle (drone) that is remotely controlled or even autonomous. It contains a sensor system aimed at searching for survivors, or in other words, detecting human presence. The sensor system is connected to a special website for the civil defense crew, which displays an interface providing information about the areas targeted by the dove and its sensors.
